# Product Requirements Document: arXiv MCP Server

## Introduction/Overview

The arXiv MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables Claude Code to search arXiv papers using natural language queries and download selected papers as PDFs. This feature solves the problem of researchers and developers needing to manually navigate arXiv's interface and construct complex search queries to find relevant academic papers.

The goal is to create a seamless, AI-powered research assistant that understands natural language requests like "find math papers about combinatorics published after Dec 2024" and can automatically search, present results, and download selected papers to a designated folder.

## Goals

1. **Enable Natural Language Search**: Allow users to search arXiv using conversational queries instead of complex search syntax
2. **Streamline Paper Discovery**: Reduce time spent manually browsing arXiv by providing intelligent, contextual search results
3. **Automate Paper Management**: Provide one-click download functionality with organized file storage
4. **Integrate with Claude Code**: Leverage MCP protocol for seamless integration with Claude's development environment
5. **Support Batch Operations**: Enable efficient downloading of multiple papers simultaneously

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

**As a researcher**, I want to search for papers using natural language so that I can quickly find relevant academic work without learning arXiv's query syntax.

**As a developer**, I want to download research papers directly through Claude Code so that I can access reference materials without leaving my development environment.

**As an academic**, I want to batch download multiple papers so that I can efficiently collect resources for literature reviews.

**As a student**, I want papers organized in folders by category and date so that I can maintain a structured research library.

### Secondary User Stories

**As a research team member**, I want to share search queries and results so that team members can access the same paper collections.

**As a power user**, I want to filter search results by specific criteria (date, author, category) so that I can refine my research focus.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Search Functionality
1. The system must accept natural language search queries in English
2. The system must parse natural language into structured arXiv search parameters including:
   - Keywords and search terms
   - Academic categories (e.g., math.CO, cs.AI, physics.quant-ph)
   - Date ranges (published after/before specific dates)
   - Author names
   - Maximum number of results
3. The system must integrate with arXiv's official API for paper retrieval
4. The system must return search results with complete metadata including:
   - Paper title
   - Author list
   - Abstract (truncated for display)
   - arXiv ID
   - Categories/subjects
   - Published and updated dates
   - PDF download URL
5. The system must support result pagination for large search results
6. The system must implement rate limiting (3-second delays) to comply with arXiv's API guidelines

### Download Management
7. The system must download papers as PDF files using their arXiv ID
8. The system must create organized folder structures: `downloads/YYYY-MM/category/`
9. The system must name downloaded files using format: `{arxiv_id}_{sanitized_title}.pdf`
10. The system must detect and prevent duplicate downloads
11. The system must support batch downloading of multiple papers
12. The system must provide download progress feedback for batch operations
13. The system must handle download failures with retry logic and error reporting

### MCP Integration
14. The system must implement FastMCP server architecture
15. The system must expose three primary MCP tools:
    - `search_arxiv`: Natural language search functionality
    - `download_paper`: Single paper download
    - `batch_download`: Multiple paper download
16. The system must provide proper tool descriptions for Claude Code integration
17. The system must handle async operations for non-blocking performance
18. The system must validate input parameters using Pydantic models

### Configuration and Environment
19. The system must support environment-based configuration via .env files
20. The system must allow configurable download directories
21. The system must integrate with OpenAI API for natural language processing
22. The system must provide example MCP configuration for Claude Code setup

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Web Interface**: This feature will not include a standalone web application - integration is solely through MCP/Claude Code
2. **Paper Analysis**: The system will not perform content analysis, summarization, or citation extraction from downloaded papers
3. **User Authentication**: No user accounts, login systems, or personalized settings beyond local configuration
4. **Paper Hosting**: The system will not store or redistribute papers - it only facilitates download from arXiv's official servers
5. **Advanced Search Operators**: Complex boolean logic or advanced arXiv search operators beyond natural language parsing
6. **Real-time Notifications**: No alerts for new papers or saved search monitoring
7. **Collaboration Features**: No sharing, commenting, or team collaboration functionality
8. **Mobile Support**: No mobile app or responsive web interface
9. **Alternative Paper Sources**: Integration limited to arXiv only, no support for other academic databases

## Design Considerations

### User Experience
- Search results should be presented in a clean, numbered list format for easy selection
- Error messages should be clear and actionable (e.g., "No papers found matching your criteria. Try broader search terms.")
- Download progress should be visible for batch operations
- File organization should be intuitive and consistent

### Technical Architecture
- Use FastMCP framework for MCP server implementation
- Implement async/await patterns for non-blocking operations
- Use Pydantic models for type safety and data validation
- Follow Python best practices with proper error handling and logging

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies
- **mcp[cli]>=1.2.0**: Core MCP framework
- **arxiv>=2.1.0**: Official arXiv API wrapper
- **openai>=1.0**: LLM integration for natural language parsing
- **pydantic>=2.0**: Data validation and settings management
- **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management
- **aiofiles**: Async file operations
- **httpx**: Async HTTP client for downloads

### Integration Requirements
- Must integrate with existing Claude Code MCP configuration
- Requires OpenAI API key for natural language processing
- Should respect arXiv's rate limiting and terms of service
- Must handle network failures and API timeouts gracefully

### Performance Considerations
- Implement connection pooling for HTTP requests
- Use async operations to prevent blocking during downloads
- Cache category mappings to reduce processing overhead
- Implement proper memory management for large file downloads

## Success Metrics

### Functional Success
1. **Search Accuracy**: 90%+ of natural language queries should return relevant results
2. **Download Success Rate**: 95%+ of download attempts should complete successfully
3. **Response Time**: Search results should be returned within 10 seconds for typical queries
4. **API Compliance**: Zero rate limit violations or API access issues

### User Experience Success
5. **Query Understanding**: Users should successfully find papers using conversational language without learning arXiv syntax
6. **Workflow Integration**: Researchers should report improved efficiency in paper discovery and collection
7. **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages should enable users to resolve issues independently

### Technical Success
8. **Reliability**: System should maintain 99%+ uptime during normal operations
9. **Scalability**: Support concurrent searches and downloads without performance degradation
10. **Maintainability**: Code should follow established patterns for easy future enhancements

## Open Questions

1. **Search Result Limits**: What should be the default and maximum number of search results returned per query?
2. **Storage Management**: Should the system implement automatic cleanup of old downloads or storage quotas?
3. **Category Mapping**: How comprehensive should the natural language to arXiv category mapping be? Should it support domain-specific terminology?
4. **Error Handling**: What level of detail should be provided in error messages for API failures or network issues?
5. **Configuration**: Should advanced users be able to customize search parameters (sort order, result fields) through configuration?
6. **Logging**: What level of logging is needed for troubleshooting and usage analytics?
7. **Future Extensions**: Should the architecture support future integration with other academic databases (PubMed, IEEE, etc.)?
